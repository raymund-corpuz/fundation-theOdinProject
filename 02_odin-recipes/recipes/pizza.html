    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy, featuring a round, flat
      dough base topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and a variety of toppings
      like meats, vegetables, and herbs. Baked until the crust is golden and the
      cheese is melted and bubbly, pizza is known for its delicious flavor and
      endless customization options. Whether enjoyed with classic toppings like
      pepperoni and mozzarella or creative ones like pineapple or arugula, pizza
      is a universal favorite that's perfect for any meal or gathering.
