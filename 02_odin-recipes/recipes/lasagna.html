    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers sheets of pasta with rich,
      savory fillings to create a hearty and comforting meal. Traditionally, it
      features a robust meat sauce made from ground beef or pork simmered with
      tomatoes, garlic, and onions, paired with a creamy béchamel or ricotta
      cheese mixture. Each layer is carefully built, combining the tender pasta
      with the flavorful sauces and generous amounts of mozzarella, resulting in
      a deliciously gooey and satisfying bite once baked to golden perfection.
